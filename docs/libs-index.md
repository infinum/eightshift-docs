This library is aimed at bringing the modern development tools to the [Eightshift Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate) or [Eightshift Boilerplate Plugin](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate-plugin), but you can use it on any WordPress project.

It uses a dependency injection container that provides a way to inject dependencies into classes so that they obey the single responsibility principle (SRP). Every class is responsible for registering its own hooks, which will be loaded automatically by the dependency injection container. This provides a more testable environment for your project.

We provide some helpers, abstract classes, interfaces and abstractions on original WordPress functionality to help you write more modern code.
