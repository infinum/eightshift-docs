# Getting started

## Installation

It's easy to get started!

### Get the package
Install the `@eightshift/ui-components` package with your package manager of choice.

### Import the styles

At the minimum you have to import the main styles, which come in 3 flavors:

1. *For generic usage*
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style.css';
```
Uses cascade layers to separate styles, includes the default CSS reset.

2. *For the WP Gutenberg editor*
 ```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style-editor.css';
```
Cascade layers are not used, CSS reset is included.

3. *For the WP admin area*
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style-admin.css';
```
Cascade layers are not used, CSS reset is opt-in using the `es:css-reset` class.

#### Extras
To expand the font coverage to the Block editor (even the Gutenberg components), import:
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-font-enhancements.css';
```

Optionally, import the WordPress UI enhancements, which correct some of the inconsistencies in the default components.

```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-ui-enhancements.css';
```

:::caution
If using Frontend libs version 12 or older, skip the WordPress UI enhancements, as they will conflict with the styles included there.
:::

#### Recommended WordPress setup
`application-blocks-editor.css`
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-font-enhancements.css';
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-ui-enhancements.css';
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style-editor.css';
```

`application-admin.css`
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style-admin.css';
```

### Enjoy!

That's all! You are ready to use Eightshift UI components in your project.
