# Getting started

## Installation

It's easy to get started!

### Get the package
Install the `@eightshift/ui-components` package with your package manager of choice.

### Import the styles

At the minimum you have to import
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style.css';
```

We strongly recommend importing the font as well. This will ensure consistency between platforms and improve the overall look and feel.
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/fonts.css';
```

To expand the font coverage to the Block editor (even the Gutenberg components), import:
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-font-enhancements.css';
```

Optionally, import the WordPress UI enhancements, which correct some of the inconsistencies in the default components.

```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-ui-enhancements.css';
```

:::caution
If using Frontend libs version 12 or older, skip the WordPress UI enhancements, as they will conflict with the styles included there.
:::

#### Recommended setup
```scss
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/fonts.css';
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-font-enhancements.css';
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/wp-ui-enhancements.css';
@import '~@eightshift/ui-components/dist/assets/style.css';
```

### Enjoy!

That's all! You are ready to use Eightshift UI components in your project.
