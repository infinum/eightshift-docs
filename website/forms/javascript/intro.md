In JavaScript, similar to PHP filters and global variables, there are various built-in functions available. This chapter will delve into the ways you can modify and adapt these functions to your specific needs.

You can customize both the Block Editor and Frontend forms with different options. On the Frontend, the global window object `esForms` provides all the necessary features. Additionally, there are multiple events triggered by various actions which you can utilize.

Crucially, the Frontend forms employ a specially-designed state management system that handles all data-related operations.

If you require further customization options, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms/issues/new/choose) and we will work on adding it as soon as possible.
