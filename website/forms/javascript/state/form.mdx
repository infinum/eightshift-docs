import { WindowObject } from './../../../src/docs/js.jsx';

The `form` object contains all getters and setters for managing the form. All methods are connected to the `formId` value.

For example, here you will find events that fire when field value changes like hover, blur, focus, etc. Also, you can find all helpers to store data in the internal `FormData` object before sending it to the Rest-API.

<WindowObject name="Form" filter="form" url="form" />

### Example

This example will return event listeners for all forms on your page.

```js
window?.esForms?.form?.removeEvents();
```

This example will initialize input field by name and formId.

```js
window?.esForms?.form?.setupInputField('<fieldName>', '<formId>');
```
