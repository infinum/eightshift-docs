You can listen to these events by using the `on` method on the `Event` facade.

Every event contains the whole window object inside the details property.
This way you can be sure that everything is set and ready to be used. Additionally if an event is a part of the `after` event you can use the `additional` property to get the API response details. 

:::note
List of all events can be found [here](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms/blob/develop/src/Blocks/manifest.json).

:::tip
All events are set on the window element.
