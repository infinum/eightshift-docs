2. Create a form in the WordPress admin
3. Configure the form and add the fields needed
4. Add the _Form picker_ block in the place you want to show the form, and select your newly created form

## Create a form

To create a form, open the WordPress admin, find _Eightshift Forms_ in the sidebar, then click on _Add new form_.

An editing screen will open, with a selector for the form type. If you don't see a form type in the selector, make sure it's enabled in the Dashboard.

After clicking the form type, the Form block will be automatically added, the form initialized, and some fields may be added by default.
