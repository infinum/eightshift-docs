Integrations with external services give Eightshift Forms its power of automation. You can connect your forms with any supported services and send data to them. In general, we support two ways of form connections.

## Integration provided form builder

If an external service provides the form builder, you can create your form there and use Eightshift Forms to connect with that form. All important data will be synced with the push of a button. Also, forms allow you to use more advanced features like conditional logic and multi-step forms not provided in any external services.

### How to use it?
1. Connect the API data.
2. Create a form on the external service.
3. Create a new form in Eightshift Forms and select the external service block used.
4. Select the form you created in step 2 using the forms picker.
5. Click publish, and you are ready to go.

### What if the form changed on the external service?
1. Open that form on Eightshift Forms.
2. Click the clear cache button to get the latest data from the external service.
3. Click the sync data button to sync the data with the external service.
4. Click publish, and you are ready to go.

## Integration not provided form builder

If the external service doesn't provide any form builder or doesn't support API, you can use Eightshift forms to create forms like you would create a simple mailer form and then connect the fields with the external service. This way, you can use all the power of Eightshift Forms to create your forms and then send the data to the external service.

### How to use it?
1. Connect the API data.
2. Create a new form in Eightshift Forms and add all necessary fields.
3. Click publish and open form settings.
4. Fill out needed data in the form settings to map fields to the external service.
5. Click save, and you are ready to go.

### What if the form changed on the external service?
1. As the form is not connected to the external service form builder, there is no way form data can go out of sync.
