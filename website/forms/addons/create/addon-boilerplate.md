We have created a boilerplate for creating a new add-on for the Eightshift Forms plugin. This boilerplate will help you to create a new add-on with the correct structure and naming conventions.

You can download the boilerplate from the [Eightshift Forms Add-on Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms-addon-boilerplate) repository.

## How to use the boilerplate add-on
1. Clone the [Eightshift Forms Addon Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms-addon-boilerplate) repository.
2. Rename the `eightshift-forms-addon-boilerplate` folder to `eightshift-forms-addon-<addon-name>`.
3. Rename the `EightshiftFormsAddonBoilerplate` string to `EightshiftFormsAddon<AddonName>`.
4. Rename the `eightshift-forms-addon-boilerplate` string to `eightshift-forms-addon-<addon-name>`.
5. Rename all other instances of `Boilerplate` to your add-on name.
6. Run the `composer install` command to install the required dependencies.
7. Add the add-on plugin to you projects plugins folder.
8. Activate the add-on plugin.
