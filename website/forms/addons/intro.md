Starting from version 3 of Eightshift Forms, custom add-on plugins are now supported, which can be used along with the main plugin to enhance its functionality.

We will update this page's list of [free](free/intro) and [premium](premium/intro) plugins available for Eightshift Forms.

### Want to create your own add-on plugin?
