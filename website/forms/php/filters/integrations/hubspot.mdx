## Files options filter
This filter is used to change default file upload options set by forms and Hubspot. We use this [api](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/files/v3/upload_new_file), and you can change any of these options.

```php
add_filter('es_forms_integrations_hubspot_files_options', 'getFileUploadCustomOptions');
