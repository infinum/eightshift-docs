Eightshift Forms offers static helpers that can be implemented in your project. The key difference between these helpers and filters is that you can use the former in your theme or plugin code regardless of the load cycle.

All helpers can be found [here](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms/blob/main/src/Helpers/publicHelper.php).
