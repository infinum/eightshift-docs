In Eightshift Forms we use multiple ways to provide customizability to your project. PHP customizations are the most powerful way to customize your forms and by using WordPress native filters and global variables you will be able to customize almost anything.

If you require further customization options, please don't hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms/issues/new/choose) and we will work on adding it as soon as possible.
