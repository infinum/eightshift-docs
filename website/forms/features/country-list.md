We use [DataHub](https://datahub.io/core/country-list) as database for providing the list of countries. Eightshift forms are not  biased towards any country and has no political agenda. We use this list because it is the most complete and up to date list of countries.

All releases are listed [here](https://datahub.io/core/country-list) and you can find our list [here](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-forms/blob/develop/data/country/manifest.json).

## Where is the country list used?

We use the country list in the following features:
* country block
* phone blocks
* geolocation features

## How to add a new country or create a new list?

If you want to add a new country or create a new list, you can do so by adding a custom filter in your project. You can find more details on how to do that [here](/forms/php/filters/block/country/alternative-data-set).
