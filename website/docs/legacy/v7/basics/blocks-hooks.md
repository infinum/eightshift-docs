WordPress block editor hooks provide the same functionalities as PHP hooks. They are used to modify the behavior of the existing blocks.

You can check the [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/filters/block-filters/) on this subject.

We didn't change anything here regarding the original documentation; we simply provided you with the structured file where you can write all your hooks.

Please follow this [example](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-frontend-libs/tree/6.0.0/blocks/init/src/Blocks/custom/column/column-hooks.js) to get more insights on using hooks in your project.
