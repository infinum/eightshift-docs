This library is aimed at bringing the modern front end development tools to the [Eightshift Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate) or [Eightshift Boilerplate Plugin](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate-plugin), but you can use it on any WordPress project.

## Prerequisites

The knowledge of the core editor components and React.js is recommended since this library is focused on working with new editor, and contains custom blocks. If you want to create your own custom blocks, that knowledge will come in handy.

The library can be used for pure webpack/js/scss functionality, but if the blocks are to be used, [Eightshift Libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-libs/) must be used in tandem.

## The library contains

- All js packages required for the webpack build
- ESLint ruleset
- StyleLint ruleset
- Babel ruleset
- A collection of useful front-end utility modules
- Complete storybook of over 30+ useful blocks and components.
- Block Editor Block example
- Block Editor Blocks initial setup for [Eightshift Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate)
- Some cool custom components for Block Editor
- Complete webpack build for [Eightshift Boilerplate](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate)
- Helpers for creating dynamimc Block Editor blocks
- ...
