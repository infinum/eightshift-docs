Language translation class is located in `Eightshift Libs`. To extend it use `Eightshift_Libs\I18n\I18n` class.

To provide language translation put all your `.po`and `.mo` files inside `src/i18n` folder.

You can find more on language documentation on [official WordPress docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/load_theme_textdomain/).
