Check the list below for details about changes that will have to be made.

Also, a couple of changes are optional, but recommended.

The major update on this release is the support for PHP 8+. 

## PHP support

**Migration time: ~5min.**

### PHP 8+

To allow support for PHP 8+ you need to update [Eightshift Libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate/tree/develop) to the latest version and update your project's `composer.json` to all the latest [package](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate/blob/develop/composer.json) versions.

:::tip
Don't forget to update the required PHP version in `composer.json` and run `composer update`.
:::

### PHP 7.4+

The latest version of the [Eightshift Libs](https://github.com/infinum/eightshift-boilerplate/tree/develop) still supports PHP 7.4+. If you cannot update to PHP 8+, update `composer.json` packages to all the latest versions, except these packages, which should stay on the previous versions:

```json
"dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer": "v0.7.2",
"infinum/eightshift-coding-standards": "1.6.0",
```

## Required changes

**Migration time: ~5min.**

#### Remove deprecated functions from blocks

If you used the `getAllBlocksListOld` or `getCustomCategoryOld` functions in your blocks, remove them and the respective action hooks, as these functions are no longer available.

#### Enqueue the `lodash` library

From WordPress version 6.4+, the core `lodash` library is no longer enqueued by default. We have an internal dependency to this library, so you should enqueue it in your project if you made any changes to the `getAdminScriptDependencies` function in the `EnqueueBlocks.php` file.

You can skip this step if you didn't change anything in that function.

## Optional changes

**Migration time: ~5min.**

The following changes are not required, but you might consider adding them to have all the latest modifications.

#### Update your Config.php file

- We changed the `Config.php` file to use the project name using `TextDomain` and the version using `Version` defined in your `style.css` file.
