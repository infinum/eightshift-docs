Let's create a new plugin!

Navigate to your WordPress plugins folder and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-wp-project plugin
```

The script will prompt you for a plugin name and local development URL (used for BrowserSync). After that, your new plugin will be installed:

![](/img/setup.gif)

After the script is finished, please follow the instructions provided by the setup script.

All additional steps after the initial setup are done using WP_CLI commands, so please make sure that you have WP-CLI set and ready to use.

## What is next?

Now that we have the plugin set on your local environment, let's do something with it.

Please make sure you read the [Basics chapter](basics/basics-intro) to better understand how the project is set and what is included to make your developing experience as smooth as possible.
